    "$$ O(Y=1) = \\frac{P(Y=1)}{P(Y=0)} $$ \n",
    "For example, if $P(Y=1) = 0.2$ then $O(Y=1)=\\frac{0.2}{0.8}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so we say the odds of being sick are one-to-four, which we write as 1:4. \n",

    "The odds of being healthy are simply reversed (i.e., the reciprocal of $O(Y=1)$):\n",
    "$$ O(Y=0) = \\frac{P(Y=0)}{P(Y=1)} $$ \n",

    "### Odds Ratio\n",
    "Now, in order to express the association between some symptom(s) (e.g., $X_{\\text{cough}}$) and the outcome $Y$, we can use the *odds ratio*: \n",
    "$$ \\text{OR}(Y=1 : X_{\\text{cough}}=1) = \\frac{O(Y=1 \\mid X_{\\text{cough}}=1)}{O(Y=1)}$$\n",
    "which tells us how the odds of having the flu change when conditioning on a symptom ($X_{\\text{cough}}=1$, here).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the odds of having the flu ($Y=1$) are 2:3 if a person has a cough (compared to overall 1:4 odds). Then the odds ratio is $\\frac{8}{3}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" width=\"450\" height=\"100\" src=\"./images_tutorial/Ball_Diagrams/Ball_Diagrams.004.half.png\">\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Interpretation 1:** \"The odds of *having the flu* roughly triple when the person has a cough\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, odds ratios of 'healthy' vs 'sick' are reciprocals of each other:\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" width=\"900\" height=\"200\" src=\"./images_tutorial/Ball_Diagrams/Ball_Diagrams.004.tight.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crucially**, the odds ratio can also be written in another (mathematically equivalent, by Bayes' rule) way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{OR}(Y=1 : X_{\\text{cough}}=1) = \\frac{P(X_{\\text{cough}} =1 \\mid Y=1)}{P(X_{\\text{cough}}=1 \\mid Y=0)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this for the example above, $\\text{OR}(Y=1 : X_{\\text{cough}}=1) = \\frac{8}{3}$ can also be interpreted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpretation 2:** \"A person is almost three times as likely to *have a cough* if they have the flu compared to when they are healthy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering multiple conditioning variables (symptons), it is useful to take the logarithm of odds and odds ratios, so that they can be **added** (instead of multiplied). For example, if $X_{\\text{cough}}$ and $X_{\\text{fever}}$ are independent, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log  \\text{OR}(Y=1 : X_{\\text{cough}} , X_{\\text{sneezing}} )  = \\log  \\text{OR}(Y=1 : X_{\\text{cough}} )  +  \\log  \\text{OR}(Y=1 : X_{\\text{sneezing}} )$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, adding up all the WoE scores plus the log priors, we (approximately) recover the posterior probabilities that the model outputs.\n",
